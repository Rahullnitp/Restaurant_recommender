The recommender system discovers data patterns in the dataset by learning consumerâ€™s choices and produces the outcomes that co-relate to their needs and interest.
In this project, I propose a restaurant recommender system in a mobile environment. This recommender system adopts a user preference model by using the features of the user's visited restaurants and also utilizes the location information of users and restaurants to dynamically generate the recommendation results.
There are various types of Recommendation systems but for this restaurant recommendation system that I build, I focused on using Matrix Factorization or Latent Factor Collaborative Filtering and Weighted rating for the new users.
